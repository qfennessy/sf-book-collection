# Environments and Deployment

## 1. Overview

This project utilizes several deployment environments:

*   **Local Development:** Used by developers on their machines for coding and initial testing.
*   **Testing/QA:** A shared environment for formal testing and quality assurance. Mirrors production closely.
*   **Staging:** A pre-production environment for final checks, demos, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Often an exact replica of production.
*   **Production:** The live environment accessible to end-users.

## 2. Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   `[Runtime Version, e.g., Node.js v18+, Python 3.10+, Java 17+]`
    *   `[Package Manager, e.g., npm, yarn, pip, maven, gradle]`
    *   `[Database System, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB]` (Ensure it's installed and running)
    *   `[Other Tools, e.g., Docker, Git]`
*   **Repository Cloning:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Repository URL]
    cd [Project Directory]
    ```
*   **Dependency Installation:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js
    npm install

    # Example for Python
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Example for Java (Maven)
    mvn install
    ```
    *(Replace with the actual command for your project)*
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Configuration is managed via environment variables, often loaded from a `.env` file (which should be in `.gitignore`).
    *   Copy the example configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Edit the `.env` file with your local settings. Key variables include:
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your local database.
        *   `API_KEY_SECRET`: Secret key for [purpose, e.g., JWT signing].
        *   `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`: URL for [service].
        *   `PORT`: Port the application will run on (e.g., 3000, 8080).
        *(Add/remove variables as needed)*
*   **Running the Application:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js
    npm start

    # Example for Python/Django
    python manage.py runserver

    # Example for Java/Spring Boot
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    *(Replace with the actual command)*
    The application should be available at `http://localhost:[PORT]`.
*   **Running Tests Locally:**
    Refer to the `TESTING.md` document for details. Typically:
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js
    npm test

    # Example for Python
    pytest

    # Example for Java (Maven)
    mvn test
    ```
    *(Replace with the actual command)*

## 3. Other Environments

### Testing/QA

*   **Purpose:** Integration testing, regression testing, exploratory testing by the QA team.
*   **Access:** `[URL, e.g., https://test.yourapp.com]`
*   **Credentials:** [How to obtain test accounts/credentials].
*   **Configuration:** Uses test-specific database, keys, and external service endpoints (sandboxes if available).
*   **Deployment:** [e.g., Automatically deployed from `develop` branch via CI/CD, Manual deployment].

### Staging

*   **Purpose:** Final validation before production release, UAT, performance testing, demos. Aims to mirror production identically.
*   **Access:** `[URL, e.g., https://staging.yourapp.com]`
*   **Credentials:** [How to obtain staging accounts/credentials, often limited access].
*   **Configuration:** Uses production-like configuration but separate databases, keys, and potentially sandboxed external services.
*   **Deployment:** [e.g., Automatically deployed from `main`/`master` branch after successful QA via CI/CD, Tag-based manual deployment].

### Production

*   **Purpose:** Live application serving end-users.
*   **Access:** `[URL, e.g., https://www.yourapp.com]`
*   **Credentials:** Production user accounts. Admin access is highly restricted.
*   **Configuration:** Production-specific database, keys, and live external service endpoints. Security is paramount.
*   **Deployment:** [e.g., Manual deployment process involving checks and approvals, triggered from release tags/branches via CI/CD]. Requires careful monitoring post-deployment.
