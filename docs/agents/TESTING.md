# Testing Strategy

## 1. Philosophy/Strategy

This project follows the **[Testing Approach, e.g., Test Pyramid]** philosophy. We aim for a high level of confidence through a combination of tests at different levels:

*   **Many fast Unit Tests:** Verify individual components in isolation.
*   **Fewer Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components.
*   **Even fewer End-to-End Tests:** Verify user flows through the deployed application.

Our goal is to catch bugs early, ensure code quality, and facilitate refactoring.

## 2. Types of Tests

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   **Scope:** Test individual functions, methods, classes, or components in isolation. Dependencies are mocked or stubbed.
    *   **Tools/Frameworks:** `[e.g., Jest, Mocha/Chai (JavaScript), pytest (Python), JUnit/Mockito (Java)]`
    *   **Location:** Typically found alongside the source code (e.g., `src/**/*.test.js`, `tests/unit/`).
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   **Scope:** Test the interaction between multiple components, such as API endpoints interacting with the database, or service-to-service communication. May require a running database or other services (often containerized).
    *   **Tools/Frameworks:** `[e.g., Supertest (Node.js API testing), Spring Boot Test (Java), pytest with fixtures]`
    *   **How Run:** Often run as part of the main test suite but may be tagged separately.
    *   **Dependencies:** May require a test database, potentially managed by tools like Testcontainers or specific setup scripts.
    *   **Location:** Often in a separate test directory (e.g., `tests/integration/`).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   **Scope:** Simulate real user scenarios by interacting with the application through its UI or API as a black box. Test complete workflows.
    *   **Tools/Frameworks:** `[e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium (Frontend E2E), Postman/Newman (API E2E)]`
    *   **Setup:** Requires a fully deployed instance of the application (local or a dedicated test environment).
    *   **Location:** Usually in a dedicated E2E test suite directory (e.g., `tests/e2e/`, `cypress/integration/`).
*   **(Optional) Performance Tests:**
    *   **Scope:** Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization under load.
    *   **Tools:** `[e.g., k6, JMeter, Locust]`
*   **(Optional) Security Tests:**
    *   **Scope:** Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
    *   **Tools:** `[e.g., OWASP ZAP, SonarQube (Static Analysis), Dependency Checkers]`

## 3. Running Tests

*   **Run All Tests:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js
    npm test

    # Example for Python
    pytest

    # Example for Java (Maven)
    mvn test
    ```
    *(Replace with the actual command)*
*   **Run Specific Tests/Types:**
    ```bash
    # Example: Run tests matching a pattern (Jest/pytest)
    npm test -- -t "user login"
    pytest -k "user_login"

    # Example: Run tests in a specific file (Jest/pytest)
    npm test src/utils/auth.test.js
    pytest tests/unit/test_auth.py

    # Example: Run only unit tests (if tagged or structured)
    pytest -m unit
    mvn test -Dgroups=unit
    ```
    *(Adjust commands based on the test runner)*
*   **Test Environment Setup:**
    *   Unit tests typically require no special environment.
    *   Integration tests may require a running database. [Explain how it's set up, e.g., Docker Compose file `docker-compose.test.yml`, Testcontainers].
    *   E2E tests require a running application instance. [Explain how to point tests to it, e.g., environment variables like `CYPRESS_BASE_URL`].

## 4. Test Coverage

*   **Measurement:** Code coverage is measured using `[Coverage Tool, e.g., Istanbul/nyc, coverage.py, JaCoCo]`.
*   **Reporting:** Coverage reports are generated after running tests (check tool documentation). They are often integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Standards:** We aim for a minimum of `[Target Percentage, e.g., 80%]` line/branch coverage for new code, focusing on critical business logic. *(Adjust target as needed)*

## 5. Writing Tests

*   **Naming Conventions:** `[e.g., test files named *.test.js or test_*.py, test functions start with test_]`
*   **Structure:** Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.
*   **Clarity:** Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
*   **Isolation:** Unit tests must be independent and not rely on external state or the order of execution.
*   **Mocks/Stubs:** Use mocks/stubs appropriately to isolate the unit under test.
*   **Assertions:** Make specific and meaningful assertions.
